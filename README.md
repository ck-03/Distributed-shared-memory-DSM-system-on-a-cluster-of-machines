## Distributed-shared-memory-DSM-system-on-a-cluster-of-machines
The goal of this project is to implement a distributed shared memory system, which provides a
shared memory space across multiple machines in a distributed system. The application of
distributed shared memory is to allow multiple processes to communicate and share data
without the need for explicit message passing or serialization, thus reducing communication
overhead and improving system performance.
For this project, we plan to use a cluster of four systems to create a distributed environment.
Each system will act as a node in the distributed system and will have its own local memory,
which will be used to store and access shared data.
